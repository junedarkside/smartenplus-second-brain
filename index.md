## Active Projects

- [[seo-sitemap-whole-site-audit-2026-06-11]] — **MERGED 2026-06-12** (`1f3f7a2` → develop `d88f50b`, pushed). 3-agent whole-site SEO+sitemap audit → P0+P1+P2 implemented: fake reviews deleted ×**4** sources (impl found 4th in AirportTransferJsonLd.js), sitemap 128→86 URLs + robots disallows, noindex fixed/added on 5 private pages, activities canonical → NEXT_PUBLIC_DOMAIN, 480-line dead JSON-LD pipeline deleted, hreflang removed, xmlns http://, 301s for homepagev1/v2 + trips/detail, Promise.all + escapeXml in server-sitemap, GTM out of Head. Build exit 0, 8 regression greps clean. Remaining: deploy to prod, P0-1 GSC/WAF verify (manual), P0-6 nginx 301s (infra), P1-3 soft-404 per [[gsc-crawled-not-indexed-investigation-2026-06-05]], P3 dead-code sweep.

- [[frontend-architecture-audit-2026-06-11]] — **OPEN 2026-06-11.** Full FE architecture audit (state/components/fetching/perf/maintainability), 3 explorers + hand-verification. No critical bugs — architecture sound. 3 confirmed LATENT bugs: useEffect inside Formik render prop ×2 (`Passengers.js:629,706` — **debug-mantra falsified: NOT critical, no crash today** since Formik calls children once/render unconditionally → constant hook count; risk is future-edit between 625–706 + misleading eslint-disable), dead auth branch reading `getState().session` (tripsApi+dayTripsApi — NextAuth session never in Redux), wrong store key `dayTrip` vs `activities` (Accept-Language stuck 'en'). `bumpCartVersion` duplicated ×2 with manual-sync comment. 5 dead-code items grep-verified (lines*/, omisecharge/, GridComponent2, cart-migration-v1, dummy-data). Hygiene: 5 .backup files + logs git-tracked. Oversized checkout files ruled refactor-on-touch only. 4 explorer findings overturned (cloneElement memo claim FALSE, context deps claim FALSE). Checkout/payment logic excluded — see [[booking-payment-e2e-audit-2026-06-11]].

- [[frontend-audit-implementation-2026-06-11]] — **COMPLETED 2026-06-11.** All 9 audit items resolved across 3 PRs: PR1 Formik extract, PR2 4 RTK Query cleanups, PR3 dead code + hygiene. 1 cross-branch contamination incident recovered; 1 unresponsive implementer replaced. Sequential pattern adopted post-incident. Lint + build clean. 3 manual PR opens pending (no `gh` CLI).

- [[payment-deep-review-2026-06-12]] — **OPEN 2026-06-12.** 3-agent payment deep review (FE / BE / cross-repo contract) + leader hand-verification, extends [[booking-payment-e2e-audit-2026-06-11]] with zero re-derivation. 5 HIGH all leader-verified: client-controlled charge amount (no server-side total check), legacy webhook live with verification commented out, idempotent order-reuse bare response shape breaks coupon/cancel refetch (+ keyless-branch NameError), FE drops `charge_id` so explicit QR cancel-on-leave never expires, paid-but-unfinalized order invisible (mismatch swallow + reconcile gate excludes `payment_pending` + FE success from charge status alone). ~15 MEDIUM (refund over-record, orphaned Omise charge race, guest charge no email proof, KakaoPay dead end-to-end, 3DS excluded from sweeps, lock-order inversion), ~15 LOW, 10 test gaps, 4 doc drifts, BE-F9 currency claim overturned. Suggested fix order in note. Report only — no code changed.

- [[payment-deep-review-verification-2026-06-12]] — **OPEN 2026-06-12.** KB verification pass on [[payment-deep-review-2026-06-12]]: 3 Explore agents cross-checked all 5 HIGHs + 18 MEDIUMs against ~1700 lines of vault payment/omise KB + read-only code spot-checks. **20 CONFIRMED · 2 REFINED (H1, M17) · 1 REFUTED (M4) · 1 KB inaccuracy (M8) · 12 KB gaps surfaced.** **M4 REFUTED** — claim that BE emits `{error:'payment_pending'}` is wrong; canonical code is `pending_charge_exists` and FE maps it (M4 subsumed by M1). M8 KB inaccuracy: [[payment-backend-charge-flow]] §5 claims email validation in `ChargeOrderView`; code shows it's only in `ExpirePendingChargeView`. 12 KB gaps (atomization candidates): payment-amount-validation-rule, payment-legacy-deprecation-map, IntegrityError cleanup pattern, order-creation-filter-rule, self-heal coverage matrix, payment-model-fields, payment-method-name-contract, useQRPolling 4xx branch, usePaymentInitialization lifecycle, usePaymentCouponManager state machine, refund validation rule, order-create response envelope contract. Implementation plan in [[payment-implement-plan-2026-06-12]].

- [[payment-implement-plan-2026-06-12]] — **OPEN 2026-06-12.** 5-batch production-safe fix sequence derived from [[payment-deep-review-2026-06-12]] + [[payment-deep-review-verification-2026-06-12]]. Batch 1: H3+H4 (~6 lines, kill 2 UX breakages). Batch 2: H2+M10 (delete legacy routes, verify zero prod traffic first). Batch 3: H1+M8 (security pair). Batch 4: H5+M5 (resilience pair). Batch 5: M1–M4, M17, LOW sweep (refunds, dead code, doc drifts, test gaps). Per-batch: file:line, exact change, verify commands, test gaps to close. NO code changes yet — implementer session picks this up.

- [[booking-payment-e2e-audit-2026-06-11]] — **CLOSED 2026-06-11 (#97).** Full booking→checkout→payment audit, FE+BE. 4 confirmed bugs fixed across 2 sessions. C1/C2 both fixed `cb817d9`: C1 = `isCartLoaded &&` gate stops premature clear-assignments before RTK Query resolves; C2 = `error?.status === 404` guard stops transient errors from nuking cartId. All bugs resolved.

- [[website-audit-full-2026-06-06-overview|website-audit-full-2026-06-06]] — **OPEN 2026-06-06.** External website audit: SEO 75/100, Speed 40/100, A11y 85/100. Critical: 10 blocking scripts, 66 inline styles, 18 non-WebP images, 13/18 touch targets <44px. Blog outranking booking pages (content depth gap). 15 priority actions ordered by impact. **3-specialist team review done:** 15 → 12 P0-P3 items with file:line refs + sprint plan. 6 audit items reclassified as ALREADY DONE (compress, WebP config, GTM deferred, InArticleCTA, ProductJsonLd on Experience, BreadcrumbList on Experience). ~18 hrs impl work. Working files: `r1-performance`, `r1-mobile-ux`, `r1-seo-ai`, `r2-skeptic`, `r3-leader-synthesis`.

- [[rate-review-uxui-audit-2026-06-06-overview|rate-review-uxui-audit-2026-06-06]] — **OPEN 2026-06-06.** 4-specialist UX/UI audit of `/rate-review` flow (list, detail, submit-review). 52 raw findings → 34 unique actionable (3 P0, 10 P1). P0: stored XSS (`dangerouslySetInnerHTML` no DOMPurify at `[reviewSlug].js:455`), `parseISO(null)` page crash (`BookingReviewList.js:43-45`), star rating ARIA broken (multiple simultaneous `aria-pressed`). P1: wrong router import breaks "Write Review" CTA, unmasked email GDPR violation, redirect produces `/rate-review/undefined` after submission. Implementation order in `r3-leader-synthesis.md`. Overall health: 4.5/10.

- [[gsc-crawled-not-indexed-investigation-2026-06-05]] — **IN PROGRESS 2026-06-05.** 52,400 "Crawled Not Indexed" root cause investigation. 3-team adversarial review. Primary cause: empty ISR trip pages (88% confidence), NOT URL pollution. `notFound: true` blanket approach OVERTURNED — 14 Koh Lipe seasonal routes at risk. 3-phase safe plan: sitemap filter → surgical noindex → three-tier model. Data collection required before any code change.

- [[blog-canonical-url-wp-subdomain-bug]] — **FIXED 2026-06-05.** GSC "Alternate page with proper canonical tag". `String.replace('http://...')` silently failed on HTTPS WP `opengraphUrl`. Canonical = WP subdomain. Fix: derive from slug. Also fixed help page regex + missing www. `3d30407` → develop.

- [[homepage-terminology-audit-2026-06-05]] — **COMPLETED 2026-06-05.** 3-agent SEO+UX+Tech audit of homepage nav/section terminology. Phase 2 production SEO review overturned /locations→/destinations consolidation (different products). Implemented: "Journeys"→"Routes", "Explore Thailand"→"Destinations", H1 fix on activities page. 3 atoms extracted.

- [[frontend-test-infrastructure-audit-2026-06-03]] — **BLOCK RELEASE 2026-06-03.** 5-agent team: Jest (719 tests, 30% fail) + Playwright (260 tests, 90% fail). 3.92% coverage vs 70% threshold. 6 CRITICAL issues: 0% BookButton coverage (payment path), checkout 30s timeout, mobile 100% fail, jest-axe missing, MUI emotion mismatch. 4-5 dev days to fix. Money flow (checkout → payment) completely unverified.

- [[experience-detail-page-redesign-2026-06-02]] — **PLANNED 2026-06-02.** Premium redesign of `/activities/detail/[slug]` → Airbnb-level experience detail page. Airbnb 5-up photo grid, trust badges, reviews moved up, timeline collapsed, 9 new components, 0 new API endpoints.
- [[experience-faq-architecture-review-2026-06-02]] — **DECISION 2026-06-02.** FAQ section on experience detail page audit. 5 sites mapped cross-repo: 1 customer-visible (hardcoded cancel text = legal risk for strict-policy operators), 4 staff/dormant (admin `age_restriction` missing, assumed API field doesn't exist, 2 generic fillers). Decision: document + 1 help-text fix, no model consolidation. Admin `age_restriction` edit deferred.

- [[gyg-page-analysis-2026-06-04-overview|gyg-page-analysis-2026-06-04]] — **INCREMENTAL 2026-06-04.** 3-specialist GYG Chiang Rai tour (product 846675) analysis vs SmartEnPlus activity detail page. 11 candidates → 5 adopted (P0 footer meta strip, P1 not-suitable-for badges + review thumbnails, P2 review sort/filter + itinerary disclaimer). 4 P3 backend debt flagged (audio guide, private group, per-aspect rating, provider response). AI summary user-deferred.

- [[experiences-2026-marketplace-redesign]] — **PLANNED 2026-06-01.** 4-phase redesign of `/activities` → world-class 2026 marketplace. Sidebar layout, 4-col grid, premium card, sort bar. Phase 1: frontend-only. Phase 2: backend filter params. Phase 3: mobile. Phase 4: iPad polish.

- [[profile-dropdown-redesign-2026-05-29]] — **COMPLETED 2026-05-29.** 3-specialist review. 11→6 items, 296px, pill trigger, bottom sheet mobile, 3-file split. MUI-preserve strategy. Implemented on `260528-feat/header-redesign-2026`.

- [[check-your-booking-redesign-2026-05-29]] — **COMPLETED 2026-05-29.** OTA utility card adopted. Illustration removed. 840px centered card, warm-surface bg, larger inputs, trust row with fixed copy. Eyebrow removed per judge ruling.

- [[destinations-redesign-review]] — Destinations section review: editorial grid vs carousel tradeoffs, image overlay patterns, mobile-first layout decisions.
- [[featured-image-header-width-bug-2026-05-30]] — **RESOLVED 2026-05-30.** `w-[1200px]` hardcoded in `0ebd755` broke mobile. Fix: revert to `w-full` + `max-w-[1200px]`. Rule: never use `w-[Npx]` on layout-spanning elements. `FeaturedImageHeader.js:121`.
- [[airport-transfer-width-audit-2026-05-30]] — **UNRESOLVED.** Post-calendar sections (StationInformation + GuidesSection) visually narrower than calendar. Root cause: inner `px-2 md:px-3` + `mx-2` margins eating into max-w-[1200px] content. Fix attempt reverted (broke layout). Next team: redesign sections as full-width with centered inner content, OR accept current padding as correct. Shared component `ProductCardContainer.js` involvement complicates fix.
- [[header-redesign-2026-spec]] — **FINAL 2026-05-28.** Adaptive Type A/B header. Type A: single-row 80px (transactional). Type B: 2-row 96px (discovery/browse). All 5 nav items kept. /blog → Type B. Dynamic layout offset. 12-file implementation plan. 4-day rollout + 2 separate PRs.
- [[hero-back-share-buttons-2row-header-fix]] — **UNVERIFIED 2026-05-30.** Back/Share pills moved from `FeaturedImageHeader` to outer wrapper of `TripDetailHero`/`DayTripHero`. Glassmorphism style. Server was in production mode — needs `npm run dev` to verify. See note for full debug trail + root causes.
- [[header-redesign-2026-implementation]] — **Days 1–3 DONE 2026-05-28.** Branch `260528-feat/header-redesign-2026` commit `a4158b0`. 10 files. QA + AT-1 redesign pending before merge.
- [[timeline-update-display-bug-2026-06-01]] — **RESOLVED 2026-06-04.** Root cause: Django `continue` skipping placeless stops from `existing_place_ids` → delete sweep wiped all stops. Fix: 5 changes across 3 repos + migration 0028. See [[django-nested-delete-sweep-pattern]].
- [[activities-day-tour-page-review-2026-06-01]] — 3-specialist code audit of `/activities?category=DAY_TOUR`. 2 Critical (skeleton mismatch, dual unlabeled search), 5 Major, 5 Minor. Fix sequence documented.
- [[activities-location-search-bug-2026-06-01]] — **IN PROGRESS.** 4-specialist team audit. Location search returns zero results. 3 critical bugs: backend text→ID type mismatch (`products/views.py:446`), `inputValue` divergence (`DayTripLocationSearch.js:20`), freetext not emitting to parent (`DayTripLocationSearch.js:26`). Fix sequence documented.
- [[activities-search-merge-review-2026-06-01]] — **UPDATED 2026-06-01.** 3-specialist review + grill. True merge "backend blocker" claim OVERTURNED — intent detection via static `keywords[]` match, no backend change needed. Blocked by tech debt: 2 incompatible `POPULAR_DESTINATIONS` sources. Next: consolidate → `utils/destinations.js` (ACT-5), then build unified `ActivitySearch` (ACT-6).
- [[header-redesign-2026-team-review]] — 3-specialist audit (Design+UX+Frontend) + second audit (UX Architecture+Visual Design+Frontend Eng). All blockers resolved. Key decisions locked: Type A/B split, keep Explore Thailand, /blog = Type B, dynamic offset 80/96px, HeaderRowsContext pattern.
- [[backend-n8n-resend-webhook]] — Resend Operator n8n webhook forwarding. send_booking_data moved to bookings/tasks.py. 4 commits, merged to develop. 3 bugs caught by scrutinize audit (import crash ×2, orphaned try block) + 1 env var crash on startup (N8N_WEBHOOK_URL missing default=None)
- [[fast-refresh-infinite-loop-audit-2026-05-23|Fast Refresh Infinite Loop Audit 2026-05-23]] — Root cause unconfirmed. RefreshTokenHandler diagnosis OVERTURNED (lastExpiryRef guard). Likely Next.js 14.2.x HMR + on-demand compilation cascade. 7 failed fixes documented. Next: debug instrumentation + git bisect
- [[currency-context-infinite-fetch-2026-05-23|CurrencyContext Infinite Fetch 2026-05-23]] — race condition + unstable selectCurrency ref; fix applied on branch 260523-fix/currency-context-infinite-fetch
- [[isr-429-cold-start-fix-2026-05-23|ISR 429 Cold-Start Fix + Stale Data 2026-05-23]] — cold `npm run dev` bursts `/front-page/` → 429; root: REVALIDATE_SECONDS=60 + refetchOnMountOrArgChange:300; fixes identified. + ISR stale data in Docker standalone, on-demand revalidation fix via Celery task
- [[README|SmartEnPlus]] — Thailand transport booking platform (Next.js 14, Redux, Omise)
- [[architecture|SmartEnPlus Architecture]] — Redux slices, RTK Query, component structure
- [[checkout-flow|SmartEnPlus Checkout]] — SSR-disabled checkout, cart, guest mode
- [[backend-architecture|SmartEnPlus Backend]] — Django apps, models, Celery, Docker
- [[operators|Operators]] — Contract, TimeSlot, ContractAddon, ContractTranslation, tour system

- [[orders|Orders]] — Order, Payment, Coupon, PassengerDetail, WebhookEvent, ManualAdjustment, lock order canonical
- [[bookings|Bookings]] — BookingItem, BookingItemAddon, ExtraItem, confirmation flow
- [[cart|Cart]] — CartItem, CartItemAddon, CartItemCheckoutInfo, Phase 2 checkout persistence
- [[accounts|Accounts]] — Account (custom user), LoggedInUser, FamilyAndFriend
- [[billings|Billings]] — BillingProfile, PaymentMethod (all Thai payment types)
- [[api-endpoints|API Endpoints]] — all public/admin/payment/cart-order endpoints
- [[docker-production|Docker Production]] — docker-compose-rds.yml, memory budgets, deploy
- [[coupons|Coupons]] — Coupon model, times_used F()+1, restrictions
- [[stations|Stations]] — Station, Location, Place, Timeline, RouteByLocationInfo
- [[policies|Policies]] — CancellationPolicy, CancellationPolicies, BaggagePolicy, GeneralInformation
- [[dialogue|Dialogue]] — Review, Thread, Post, Comment, Reaction (WordPress), GenericForeignKey patterns
- [[recommendation-system|Recommendation System]] — precompute tasks, cache warming, beat schedule, Popular Routes admin analytics page
- [[cross-sell-placement-strategy]] — **NEW 2026-06-09.** Industry standard cross-sell placement: post-booking #1 (built+mounted), trip detail #2 (live), checkout sidebar = avoid. Filtering rules: same-route exclude (station→location fallback), operational_day weekday, price filter. BD gap: no DAY_TOUR/SPA at Koh Lipe blocks value.
- [[people-also-book-checkout-audit]] — **AUDIT+FIXED 2026-06-10/11.** 3-agent + debug-mantra audit. 1 real bug confirmed (3 overturned): duplicate toast caught 409 but backend returns 400 — fixed `a64d280`. Anchor stability + ghost-item filter fixed `d64adcf`. 3 atoms extracted.
- [[rtk-cart-tag-invalidation-auto-refetch]] — Cart mutations invalidate `Cart:{cartId}` tag → `checkCartId` auto-refetches. No `onSuccess` callbacks needed. `recommendationsApi` is separate slice — NOT invalidated by cart mutations.
- [[recommendation-anchor-first-transport-rule]] — Anchor = first transport (not last). Last transport causes circular recommendations when cross-sell transports added. `CheckoutRelatedTrips.js:27`.
- [[django-400-vs-409-duplicate-cart-item]] — Backend raises 400 (not 409) for duplicate cart items. Frontend must catch 400 + check `includes('already exists')`. 409 = payment_pending only.
- [[rtk-lazy-query-tuple-misuse]] — **NEW 2026-06-11.** `useLazyXQuery` returns `[trigger, result]` tuple, takes no args — passing args + object-destructuring = silent dead code, no request fired. Detection grep: `} = useLazy`. Found live in `BookButton.js:41-43`.
- [[activity-to-activity-cross-sell]] — **NEW 2026-06-11.** `find_nearby_activities()` pivots on `primary_location`/`service_areas`. Dispatch requires `arrival_station` check (not just trip+route). 3-signal scoring: location base 50 + same category +30 + quality score 0–20 + exact location +10.
- [[booking-widget-availability-error-display]] — **NEW 2026-06-11.** DayTripBookingWidget Alert must render all 6 error flags. `advanceHourPassed` + `nonOperatingDay` were missing → blank red box. `ADVANCE_HOUR_PASSED` constant added to `dayTripConstants.js`.
- [[redux-persist-gate-scope-gap]] — **NEW 2026-06-11.** PersistGate doesn't wrap `<Component>` (`_app.js:90-97`) — pages mount pre-rehydration. Restore effects need `state._persist?.rehydrated` guard; clearing effects must also wait for API data or they gut state a later restore needed (C1 chain).
- [[checkout-formdata-persist-guard-pattern]] — **NEW 2026-06-11 #97.** C1: `isCartLoaded = !!data` gates clear-assignments effect — stops premature clear before RTK Query resolves on mount. C2: `error?.status === 404` guard in HOC catch — transient 500/network errors preserve cartId. RTK Query error shapes documented (numeric HTTP status vs string FETCH_ERROR/TIMEOUT_ERROR).
- [[tickets|Tickets]] — Ticket model, GenericForeignKey attachable to any model, HistoricalRecords audit
- [[admin-dashboard|Admin Dashboard]] — Admin interface for SmartEnPlus platform
- [[smartenplus-glassmorphism-header|Premium Glassmorphism Header]] — dark gradient glass, sticky + blur on scroll, unified 2-row, white typography, hero integration. Supersedes header-ux-v1.

- [[adr-activity-card-favorite-button|ADR: Activity Card Favorite Button]] — Extend BookmarkButton + fix BookmarkViewSet (2 ORM bugs + allow `contract` content type). No new model/migration. 3 files only.
- [[nav-header-redesign|Nav/Header Redesign]] — Full nav evolution: Phase 0 label changes (Explore Thailand, Routes, Journeys, Experiences, Guides), Phase 1 Experiences dropdown, Phase 3 backend API + bug fixes. 6-agent validation. All submenus removed — single source of truth. A11y baseline, MUI+Tailwind coordination patterns
- [[hero-banner-cms|Hero Banner CMS 2026-05-19]] — backend-controlled homepage hero, FileField+AVIF fix, admin dashboard CRUD, 5s slideshow
- [[blog-seo-performance-2026-05-20|Blog SEO & Performance 2026-05-20]] — parallel fetches, image optimization, HMR fixes, patterns to reuse
- [[hydration-infinite-refresh-fix-2026-05-20|Hydration Infinite Refresh Fix 2026-05-20]] — all-page HMR loop from 4 hydration issues; agent accuracy ~55%; PersistGate SSR pattern
- [[activities-pagination-ux-audit-2026-06-05]] — **COMPLETED 2026-06-05.** 3-specialist pagination UX audit. Load more vs infinite scroll vs numbered pages.
- [[gyg-card-rate-analysis-2026-06-05]] — **COMPLETED 2026-06-05.** GYG card rate display analysis. Display, trust badge, and pricing UX patterns.
- [[cartitems-500-error-analysis-2026-06-02]] — **RESOLVED 2026-06-02.** Cart items 500 error root cause. 3 bugs: type mismatch, exception bubbling, PARSING_ERROR display.
- [[experience-detail-ipad-mobile-redesign-2026-06-02]] — **PLANNED 2026-06-02.** iPad/mobile redesign spec for experience detail page.
- [[cross-sell-debate-review-2026-06-09]] — **COMPLETED 2026-06-09.** 3-agent BD×ENG×PM debate. Cross-sell placement: post-booking #1, trip detail #2, checkout sidebar avoided.
- [[next-priority-debate-2026-06-09]] — **COMPLETED 2026-06-09.** 3-agent next-priority debate. Decision: GTM + cross-sell mount now, journey builder gated.
- [[implementation-plan-cross-sell-2026-06-09]] — **COMPLETED 2026-06-09.** 4-agent impl plan: GTM fix → mount CheckoutRelatedTrips → wire scored API → SEO content.
- [[checkout-uxui-audit-2026-06-10]] — **OPEN 2026-06-10.** Checkout UX/UI review.

- [[payment-audit-bugs-2026-06-11]] — 4 confirmed bugs (2 MEDIUM cart-sync dead code, 2 LOW stable_id cleanup), 2 fixed candidates (formData restore, transient error nuking cartId, both cb817d9)
- [[omise-api-reference-2026-06-12]] — Full Omise API catalog (21 sections): 7 active, 3 partial, 11 not integrated; status vocabulary + authorized charge handling
- [[payment-status-enums]] — OmiseMethod constants, status machines, authorized mapping, METHOD_EXPIRY

- [[journeys|Journeys]] — UserJourneyEvent analytics, event types, metadata, dedup guard pattern
- [[design-systems]] — Token-based design system approach
- [[design-system-audit-2026-05-31]] — Design system audit: brand color (#3b5998), token gaps, hardcoded values found across components
- [[carousel-design-standard]] — Embla carousel items-per-screen breakpoints, gap values, card widths, focus ring handling
- [[admin-dashboard-contracts]] — Category registry, form flow, payload rules, helpers
- [[pdf-contract-import-research]] — Team research + decision: Django+Claude tool_use pipeline for parsing non-standard operator PDFs to update contracts. Phase 1 scope + deferred Phase 2.
- [[admin-dashboard-image-pipeline]] — Frontend image state, error reset hooks, dedup helpers
- [[operator-image-alt-caption-fields]] — **NEW 2026-06-08.** `OperatorImageGallery` alt_text + caption schema, dialog 3-field UX with auto-prefill, grid alt chain. Includes DRF silent-drop gotcha: camelCase `altText` ≠ `alt_text` returns 200 OK with field not saved.
- [[nextjs-hmr-cross-module-callback-staleness]] — **NEW 2026-06-08.** Pages Router Fast Refresh edge case: child module hot-replaces, parent module's callback stays stale → new fields silently dropped. Symptom: "only old fields persist", hard refresh may or may not fix. 5-probe detection pattern + architectural fix (move mutation INTO the dialog).
- [[django-soft-delete-s3-file-preserve]] — **NEW 2026-06-08.** Soft-delete on file-bearing model rows keeps the S3 file alive because other models may FK-reference the same path. Hard-delete would fire `post_delete` and break those references. Canonical example: `operators/views.py:1860-1868` destroy docstring. Reusable for any file-bearing model with cross-model FK refs.
- [[operator-image-soft-delete-cascade-gap]] — **NEW 2026-06-08, CORRECTED 2026-06-08.** `OperatorImageGallery` soft-delete intentionally does NOT cascade to contract `ImageGallery` rows (only `image` URL string shared, no FK). This is correct design — existing contracts are self-managed content edited via the contract management workflow. No cascade is intended. Audit-only fix: explicit copy in the admin delete dialog so the operator understands the independence when `active_contracts > 0`.
- [[django-partial-update-elif-metadata-drop]] — **NEW 2026-06-08.** Backend `partial_update` with `elif field_changed` branch silently drops all other payload fields on existing rows. First save works, every subsequent metadata edit vanishes. Fix: unconditional sync of all payload fields. Reusable for any DRF partial_update with branched write logic.
- [[image-metadata-formik-state-only-save]] — **NEW 2026-06-08.** Sub-component dialog edits ride along with parent form's existing Save button via Formik `setFieldValue`. Zero new endpoints, zero new save buttons, zero new state. Reuses `useAlert` provider + parent save flow. Tradeoff: snackbar says "updated" but data not in DB until parent Save.
- [[add-flow-metadata-helper-pattern]] — **NEW 2026-06-08.** Helpers that add an item from one model surface to another (gallery → selected set) must carry ALL metadata fields, not just `id` + `image`. Pass the whole object, destructure inside the helper. Caller-side destructuring is a silent-drop trap.
- [[two-surface-parity-shared-module]] — **NEW 2026-06-08.** When 2 UI surfaces need identical UX (grid, search, dialog, actions) over different data sources, extract `shared/` module. Each surface = thin wrapper. No duplicate code, no drift. Multiple variants stay separate components, not boolean props.
- [[admin-dashboard-component-patterns]] — Formik+Yup, RTK Query, MUI patterns, gotchas
- [[django-serializer-shadowing-pattern]] — Local class redefines imported name in same file; silently changes exposed fields. Discovered via HomeSerializer/StationSerializer in products/serializers.py.
- [[checkout-confirmation-payment-crash-2026-06-03]] — **PENDING COMMIT 2026-06-03.** Full flow fixed (9 files, 2 repos). ContractSerializer extended. ServiceTabbedInfo.js refund_hours fix. Commit + merge next session. Atoms: [[service-detail-non-transport-display]], [[contract-trip-null-non-transport-pattern]], [[copy-cartitem-trip-none-guard]], [[contract-serializer-non-transport-fields-2026-06-03]], [[checkout-null-contract-scan-2026-06-03]].
- [[contract-serializer-non-transport-fields-2026-06-03]] — **NEW 2026-06-03.** ContractSerializer had minimal fields list — missing all non-transport data. Fix: 3 helper serializers + 10 new fields. Key: `refund_hours` not `cancellation_window`. `duration` DurationField → `"8:00:00"` format, safe with `customFormatDuration`.
- [[contract-model-ambiguity-audit-2026-06-03]] — **NEW 2026-06-03.** 4-round team audit of `primary_location`/`service_areas`/`meeting_point_*`/`InfoField` casing. 6 conceptual overlaps, 1 customer-visible (i18n on `meeting_point_details`), 5 staff-side or dormant. Recommendation: document + 1 help-text fix, no model consolidation. Debates 3 (D3 casing) + D1/D4/D5 with genuine agent disagreement. S-1/S-2 overturned "dead code" claims on `Trip.route` + `meeting_point_place`.
- [[copy-cartitem-trip-none-guard]] — **NEW 2026-06-03.** `carts/utils.py:copy_cartitem_to_bookingitem()` crashed `trip.route` when `trip=None`. Guard pattern + `str()` coercion for route/station CharFields. No migration.
- [[checkout-null-contract-scan-2026-06-03]] — **RESOLVED 2026-06-03.** Full scan of checkout for unguarded contract/trip access. 1 real bug found + fixed (`05fc0aa`): `Passengers.js:1097` trip header label. All other flagged sites verified safe (JSX short-circuit guards).
- [[contract-trip-null-non-transport-pattern]] — **NEW 2026-06-03.** Non-transport contracts always have `trip=None`. Guard `contract?.trip` before accessing `departure_time`/`arrival_time`/`route`. Crashes render-root computed values without guard.
- [[service-detail-non-transport-display]] — **NEW 2026-06-03.** Booking detail page field-name contract: `general_information?.description`, `refund_hours` (not `cancellation_window`), `customFormatDuration(duration)` safe with "8:00:00" DurationField format. Reusable for any contract display in booking/order/email rendering.
- [[view-utility-call-exception-wrapper]] — **NEW 2026-06-03.** View-layer `try/except → ValidationError` wrapper for untrusted utility calls. Ensures JSON 400 instead of HTML 500 when utility crashes. Defense-in-depth, not a substitute for internal null guards.
- [[activities-sort-filter-ux]] — **NEW 2026-06-02.** State-driven button emphasis pattern (both outlined, active via badge/label). Travel app standard (Klook, Booking.com). Mobile sort bottom-sheet, desktop sort chip.
- [[homepage-experiences-section-audit-2026-05-30]] — Feasibility audit: add "Explore Experiences" carousel to homepage. Verdict: VIABLE after AT-1 + inventory check. Backend ready (Contract model). 5 files, ~160 lines. Reuses CardCarouselContainer + PopularRoutesSection pattern.
- [[transportation-category-audit-2026-05-30]] — Full audit: 3-level category system (station_type / service_category / VehicleType), airport filter vs TRANSFER category decoupled, 26 station_types, lowest_price nullable, query_count Celery mechanism. Professional homepage section redesign spec (AT-1): image card + IATA badge + carousel mobile + serializer expansion.
- [[mui-tailwind-css-specificity]] — MUI Emotion overrides Tailwind className on MUI components; use sx prop or div wrapper; sx responsive breakpoints fail without Emotion cache provider
- [[nextjs-fixed-header-per-route]] — `position: fixed` on homepage only via `router.pathname === '/'`; sticky elsewhere; `<main>` gets `pt-[88px]` on non-homepage to clear header
- [[payment-sentinel-idempotency]] — Timestamp sentinels as exactly-once guards; reusable for any side effect (email, booking, settlement)
- [[nextauth-session-shape]] — `session.user.email` not `session.email`; auth check via `session?.id`; guest email sources
- [[cart-reprovision-after-reset]] — `resetCart()` + fire-and-forget `createCart()` pattern; required on 2 order pages not wrapped in `withCartValidation`
- [[promptpay-no-webhook-on-expiry]] — PP/MB expiry has no Omise webhook; all 3 expiry paths must call `_send_payment_failed_notifications()`
- [[nextjs-isr-ratecard-empty-array-guard]] — `??` doesn't catch `[]`; use `?.length > 0` when merging CSR arrays into ISR baseline
- [[nextjs-307-vs-301-product-reclassify]] — Keep `permanent: false` on product-type redirects; 301 causes browser/CDN cache pollution on reclassification
- [[seo-homepage-specialist-team]] — SEO specialist team: 3-role sequential audit workflow, how to invoke, pre-conditions, known gaps found on first run 2026-05-21
- [[hero-88px-gap-root-cause]] — 88px white gap between header and hero on non-homepage. Double-offset: sticky reserves 88px + pt-[88px] on main. Fix: remove global pt-[88px], make spacing component-local.
- [[featured-image-header-usage-matrix]] — Cross-page FeaturedImageHeader comparison. 12 pages: 10 use component, 2 have no hero. Inconsistencies in cinematic mode, min-height, H1 size, CTA treatment.
- [[react-hooks-rules-lowercase-component]] — ESLint `next/core-web-vitals` blocks build when hooks called in lowercase-named function. PascalCase mandatory for React components, even in index.js files.
- [[smartenplus-product-positioning]] — "Thailand Travel Infrastructure Platform." 5 DNA layers (transportation, experiences, route intelligence, editorial, trust). Core value: "Explore Thailand Easily."
- [[smartenplus-2026-ux-direction]] — Strategic shift: cinematic → operational. Compact 45-60vh hero, calm premium minimalism, efficiency-first. Header, search, section redesign strategy.
- [[mobile-header-scroll-behavior-change]] — Mobile header: dynamic (relative+Slide) → permanently fixed. Spacer removed, DOM paths diverged. 4 issues documented.
- [[design-token-caption-tailwind-gotcha]] — `TYPOGRAPHY_SCALE.caption` = Tailwind string `'text-xs'` not an object. `.fontSize` = undefined. Never use in MUI `sx`. Use raw value or add parallel `MUI_FONT_SIZES` token.
- [[mui-autocomplete-inputvalue-sync]] — MUI Autocomplete `inputValue` initialized via `useState(value)` doesn't sync when controlled `value` prop changes post-mount. Fix: `useEffect(() => setInputValue(value || ''), [value])`.
- [[django-parse-int-list-text-fallback]] — `_parse_int_list` returns `[]` on text input. Caller branching to `.none()` returns zero results silently. Add text-search fallback branch.
- [[django-nested-delete-sweep-pattern]] — Exclude-based delete sweep wipes all rows when `existing_ids` set is empty. Guard: never `continue` in create branch + `if existing_ids:` before delete.
- [[django-nullable-fk-migration-pattern]] — FK `CASCADE → SET_NULL null=True` + migration. View-layer `None` without migration = `IntegrityError`. Deploy order matters.
- [[nav-label-url-slug-two-layer-strategy]] — Nav label (brand word) and URL slug (SEO word) should differ. Google indexes URLs not nav labels. Safe to change nav anytime; URL = permanent infrastructure.
- [[production-url-rename-cost-framework]] — Decision framework: refs >100 = never rename; multi-year indexed = high risk. True duplicate test before any consolidation.
- [[locations-destinations-product-split]] — /locations = routes FROM a city (departure browser). /destinations = booking TO a station (trip purchase). Different APIs, different intent. Never consolidate or cross-canonical.
- [[react-client-key-null-id-pattern]] — `id: null` sentinel for unsaved records + `_clientKey: Date.now()` for stable React key. Avoids PK collision + duplicate key warnings.
- [[react-dual-hook-url-race]] — Two hook instances owning same URL race each other. Fix: `{ enabled }` param to gate URL-sync, `isControlled` detection, `didMountRef` to skip mount-fire, MUI freeSolo string branch in `onChange`.
- [[pdf-contract-import-adversarial-review]] — 6 red flags for PDF import arch: async AI call required, soft-delete draft, remove LLM matching, pre-validation, no confidence auto-accept, large-delta warning. 3-screen UX. All must resolve before first commit.
- [[django-async-ai-call-pattern]] — Django sync LLM calls block WSGI workers. Pattern: return `task_id` immediately, Celery handles AI call, frontend polls status endpoint.
- [[react-strictmode-useref-persistence]] — **NEW 2026-06-05.** useRef state persists across StrictMode simulated remount. Mount-only `didMountRef` guards bypass on second setup, firing effects only in dev. Solution: make effects idempotent.
- [[react-state-no-op-guard-side-effect-prevention]] — **NEW 2026-06-05.** Guard `setState` callback against same-value writes: `if (prev[key] === value) return prev`. Prevents coupled side effects (page reset, URL push) from firing on no-op writes.
- [[nextjs-shallow-router-push-scroll-false]] — **NEW 2026-06-05.** `router.push({...}, undefined, { shallow: true, scroll: false })` for URL sync on filter change. Default `scroll: true` causes scroll jumps on every state change.
- [[wcag-touch-target-enforcement]] — **NEW 2026-06-06.** 3-part pattern for WCAG 2.5.5 (44×44 CSS px): (a) `TOUCH_TARGET.minHeight: '44px'` token in `designSystem.js:210`, (b) Tailwind `min-h-[44px] min-w-[44px]` OR MUI `sx={{ minWidth: 44, minHeight: 44 }}`, (c) Playwright `boundingBox` regression spec at 320/375/414 viewports. F2 batch: 5 files + 1 new spec.
- [[icon-button-size-decision]] — **NEW 2026-06-06.** 40×40px (Material medium) is default for icon buttons in dense UI. 44×44 reserved for primary CTAs. F2 of website audit shipped 44; user feedback: too big. Reverted swap/currency/profile to 40 in `fbdca15`. Apply 40 to F3 WhatsApp for consistency.
- [[mui-menu-paper-overflow-guard]] — **NEW 2026-06-06.** MUI Menu Paper has no implicit max-height. When content > viewport, rounded background ends mid-row. Fix: `MenuListProps` + `PaperProps` with `maxHeight: calc(100vh - 120px)` and `overflow: hidden/auto`. Triggered by F2 anchor re-position (ProfileImage 36→44).
- [[expandable-menu-row-mui-collapse]] — **NEW 2026-06-06.** `ExpandableMenuRow` (parent with chevron + per-row `useState` + `<Collapse>` + `aria-expanded`) + `SubMenuRow` (indented child). 3 groups in ProfileMenu save −240px default height. Use for 4+ related actions sharing a theme.
- [[rate-review-page-shell-pattern]] — Shell/skeleton pattern for rate-review pages (FeaturedImageHeader + grid + sticky sidebar).
- [[gtm-impression-dedup-sessionstorage]] — GTM impression dedup via sessionStorage guard — prevents duplicate events on re-render.
- [[django-m2m-location-join-recommendations]] — M2M location join query pattern for recommendations (`service_areas` + `primary_location`).
- [[checkout-next-btn-disable-conditions]] — Checkout Next button disable logic: all conditions that block progression.
- [[carousel-embla-align-start-mobile-snap]] — Embla carousel `align: 'start'` + mobile snap settings for consistent item alignment.

- [[ios-zoom-input-16px-rule]] — iOS auto-zoom prevention: inputs ≥16px font-size. `text-base` minimum.
- [[django-booking-creation-validation-gate]] — Validation gate at booking creation: advance_hour + stop_sale + operational_day checks.
- [[rate-review-css-audit-2026-06-06]] — CSS audit findings from rate-review pages: padding, spacing, pattern alignment with blog pages.
- [[next-font-self-host-perf-pattern]] — Next.js self-hosted font performance: `next/font` + `display: swap` + preconnect elimination.
- [[brand-name-constant-extraction]] — Extract brand name to `constants/brand.js` to prevent copy drift across SEO + UI.
- [[recommendation-type-selection-by-service-category]] — Recommendation type selection: `find_nearby_activities` for DAY_TOUR/SPA, transport-anchor for routes.
- [[star-aria-radiogroup-pattern]] — Star rating ARIA: use `role="radiogroup"` + `role="radio"` + `aria-checked`. Fixes `aria-pressed` misuse (multiple true simultaneously).
- [[pdf-parsing-pipeline-pattern]] — **NEW 2026-06-11.** Django+NotebookLM pipeline for PDF contract imports. Full flow, invariants, backend components, rate card merge strategy.
- [[pdf-import-pre-validation-rules]] — **NEW 2026-06-11.** 6 red flags + 3-screen UX for PDF import. All must resolve before first commit.

- [[payment-gateway-charge-architecture]] — GatewayCharge model, finalize_payment() SSOT, locked_amount freeze, webhook sole finalization

- [[payment-exception-catalog]] — PendingChargeError/AlreadyPaidError/LockedAmountError→409, PaymentAmountMismatchError never re-raised
- [[payment-finalize-deep-dive]] — 6 non-obvious behaviors: snapshot log-only, amount mismatch path-dependent, expired→success recovery, superseded guard, cross-order lock, CAS notification dedup
- [[payment-frontend-flow-mechanics]] — Card vs Source flows, canContinue 3-condition gate, NO_CONTINUE_METHODS, amountLocked UX, QR retry sequence, JPY scaling, OmiseScriptLoader linear-not-exponential bug
- [[payment-qr-polling-mechanics]] — 4-format response fallback chain, should_stop_polling, finalStatusCheck on expiry, guest vs auth request signatures, polling lifecycle
- [[payment-celery-expiry-strategy]] — PromptPay deterministic TTL, mobile banking polls Omise, e-wallet 30min fallback, superseded charge guard, retry wired-but-uncalled bug
- [[omise-client-integration]] — lazy init (module not instance), `_attributes` dict extraction, LINE_PAY→rabbit_linepay, reversed→PENDING, PromptPay QR URI nested path
- [[omise-attributes-dict-extraction]] — `_attributes.get()` vs direct property access; silent None bug; fields affected
- [[django-celery-beat-database-scheduler]] — DatabaseScheduler stores schedule in DB not settings.py; Django admin UI; max_retries dead without self.retry()
- [[toctou-select-for-update-before-api-call]] — lock BEFORE external API call; blocks concurrent webhook; parent record lock pattern

- [[section-render-order-principles]] — Trust before editorial, mobile scroll depth kills buried sections
- [[dompurify-xss-prevention-pattern]] — dangerouslySetInnerHTML + SSR-safe sanitization (not DOMPurify which needs window)
- [[api-mirroring-pattern-new-features]] — _fetch_X_data mirroring for new API features; reuse serializer; zero new endpoints
- [[design-system-tokens-expansion]] — Border/shadow tokens missing from designSystem.js; hardcoded rgba values across components
- [[designsystem-shadow-border-tokens]] — SHADOWS, BORDERS, BORDER_RADIUS_CLASSES token definitions for helpers/designSystem.js. Replaces hardcoded rgba() across card/dropdown components
- [[airport-transfer-at1-redesign-spec]] — AT-1 full redesign spec: image card + IATA badge + carousel mobile + serializer expansion (station_name, iata_code). Zero impact on other components
- [[layout-spacing-consistency-audit-2026-06-01]] — Cross-page layout audit: activities vs homepage vs trips. 3 inconsistencies: h-padding `p-2` wrong, grid gap mismatch (spacing=1 vs 2), `sm:py-8` minor. LAY-1 + LAY-2 fixes needed before merge.
