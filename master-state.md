## Section 1 — Session Handoff

**Updated:** 2026-06-16 (session #121 END)

**Achieved this session (#121) — Prod deploy confirm + admin-dashboard hygiene:**
- **Deploy confirmed**: FE `main` @ `19984f2` + BE `main` @ `21fbdcf` live in prod, both synced with `develop` — no pending-deploy gap.
- **admin-dashboard untracked docs** (5 files: `docs/agent-policy/SYNC.md`, `docs/operations/ENV.md`, `docs/technical/{CATEGORY_MATRIX,IMAGE_FLOW,KEY_FILES}.md`) — verified real, all already linked from `CLAUDE.md`. Committed (`5e5b984`) + pushed, fixing broken refs.
- **admin-dashboard branch cleanup**: found 33 local + 31 remote branches, every single one (besides `main`) merged into both `main` and `develop` (verified via `branch --merged` both ways, not just ancestor check). Same pattern as prior `BRANCH-CLEANUP-REMOTE` (#97). Deleted all 32 local + 29 remote stale branches. Only `main`/`develop` remain (local+remote). Zero unmerged work confirmed before delete.

**Achieved prior session (#120) — Build fix + dead-code cleanup + branch hygiene:**
- Debug-mantra root cause: `getOptimalImageQuality is not a function` broke build on 13 activity-detail pages. Re-added missing export, deleted 4 dead exports, fixed unrelated `fetcher` named-import bug. Committed `19984f2` → develop, pushed. Atom: [[dangling-export-import-bug-pattern]].

**Resume point (EXACT):**
1. **AT-1 — Airport Transfer redesign (P0).** Spec: `03-knowledge/transportation-category-audit`. `AirportTransferRouteCard.js`.
2. **SelectedOutboundSummary**: plan at `.claude/plans/check-outbound-selecting-outbound-encapsulated-tower.md`.
3. **TripDetailSchedule fareCalendar fix** (deferred): `useGetFareCalendarQuery` + `skipToken` pattern from `TripSearchFilters.js:80-99`. See [[slidecalendar2-farecalendar-prop-pattern]].

**Carry-forward bugs (open):**
- `booking_count_yesterday` (BE `products/serializers.py:353-363`) — rolling 24h not calendar yesterday.
- Hero trust signals UNGATED — accepted for now.
- Dual sort vocab: QuickSortPills PascalCase vs SortDropDown `-booked_count` — reconcile before next sort work.

**Next session: starting state**
- vault: `master` @ `2381f30` (this commit adds #121)
- FE `main`/`develop` @ `19984f2` — **deployed, live**
- BE `main`/`develop` @ `21fbdcf` — **deployed, live**
- admin-dashboard: `main` @ `5e5b984` (clean, only main+develop branches)
- content: `master` @ `3756e5b` (clean)

| **BOOKING-PAY-FIX-1** | Fix 4 verified bugs from booking-payment e2e audit | CLOSED #94. Merged `fix/checkout-stable-id-cleanup` → `develop` (`f271aef`). 53/53 tests, SM-1–SM-4 passed. | `hooks/checkout/useCartSync.js`, `components/UI/BookButton.js:41-43` |

Remaining work is BD inventory only → see CROSS-SELL-BD-INVENTORY. | done |
| **SEO-SITEMAP-FIX** | Implement fixes from whole-site SEO+sitemap audit | MERGED 2026-06-12. P0+P1+P2 `1f3f7a2` merged → develop `d88f50b`, pushed.

Build exit 0, greps clean. **Remaining:** deploy to prod, GSC Googlebot/WAF verify (manual), nginx 301s (infra), P3 dead-code sweep. Soft-404 stays with GSC-1. | develop `d88f50b`, [[seo-sitemap-whole-site-audit-2026-06-11]] |
| **CROSS-SELL-BD-INVENTORY** | BD creates Koh Lipe inventory to activate cross-sell | OPEN. BD task — no eng work. Needs: (1) return route Koh Lipe→Hat Yai Airport, (2) DAY_TOUR contracts at Koh Lipe, (3) SPA_WELLNESS contracts at Koh Lipe. Cross-sell auto-hides until `recommendation_count > 0`. **All 4 FE surfaces already live and verified 2026-06-13. GTM `item_category` + activity-detail accuracy ALSO already shipped (`hooks/useOmisePayment.js:59`+`:144`, `RelatedExperiences.js:7`) — were wrongly listed as open eng work.** Only BD inventory blocks value. Sole open eng item: multi-item post-booking (`bookingContext.js:33`, Sprint 2, not urgent). See [[cross-sell-integration-status-2026-06-13]]. | BD action |
| **BRANCH-CLEANUP-REMOTE** | 81 merged remote `origin/2606*` branches pending deletion | CLOSED #97. 42 actual branches deleted (vault count was stale). `git branch -r \| grep origin/2606 \| wc -l` → 0. `git fetch --prune` run. 45 remote branches remain (all active). | done |

| **FRONTEND-AUDIT-FOLLOWUP-1** | 2 exhaustive-deps warnings in FormikValuesSync.js:61:6 | CLOSED #97. Suppression comments added. Effect 1: refs + useState setter stable by definition. Effect 2: `cartitems?.cart_item` kept (not `cartitems`) — tighter RTK refetch trigger. Lint clean. Commit `7107516`. | `FormikValuesSync.js` |
| **FRONTEND-AUDIT-MANUAL-PRS** | Open 3 PRs on GitHub manually | DROPPED #97. All 3 branches confirmed merged into develop (`git branch -r --merged develop`). Merge commits `e5261ab`, `b6b956e`, `fbe9aab` in git log are the audit record. Retroactive PRs add no value. | 3 remote branches |
| **IMG-ALT-DEBUG-1** | Next.js HMR cross-module callback staleness | OPEN. Optional refactor: move mutation call INTO dialog component, drop parent `onSubmit` indirection.

| F11-FOLLOWUP | B2B corporate CTA strip | DEFERRED. BD recommended. Awaits product decision on 280px slot. | TBD |

| FAQ-1 | ExperienceFAQ | P0-P2 done. Admin `ageRestriction` deferred. | `admin-dashboard/DayTripDetails.js` |
| AT-1 | Airport Transfer redesign | P0. Spec: `03-knowledge/transportation-category-audit`. | `AirportTransferRouteCard.js` |
