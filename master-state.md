## Section 1 — Session Handoff

**Updated:** 2026-06-18 (session #131 END)

**Achieved this session (#131) — "People also book" checkout recommendations: 3 bugs fixed + spec analysis + anchor/recType/GTM improvements. Uncommitted on feature branches.**

- **3 production bugs fixed (FE + BE):**
  - Title `"to"` bug: `route=null` → `"" to "".trim()` = `"to"` (truthy) stopped OR chain. Fix: guard `stationRoute` behind `route !== null` → now shows real product name. `RecommendationCard.js:57–61`
  - Image = operator "t" logo: backend `ContractRecommendationSerializer` never included `image` field. Added `get_image()` using existing `ImageGallerySerializer` (first gallery image, ordered). `products/serializers.py`
  - Price = "Price on request": all 5 service finders set `_lowest_price = 0.0` on no-price → `formatPrice(0)` = null. Fixed all to `None` → serializer fallback DB query runs. `products/services.py`
  - Also: `OperatorSerializer` missing `logo_url` field added. `products/serializers.py:138`
  - Also: broken image URLs (404) now caught by `onError` → category icon fallback via `CATEGORY_CONFIG` from `ServiceCategoryBadge.js` (reused, not duplicated). `RecommendationCard.js`

- **Anchor + routing improvements (FE):**
  - Replaced `SKIP_CATS` with `ANCHOR_PRIORITY` map — all 9 categories scored, transport wins (100), EVENT/ATTRACTION_TICKET no longer excluded
  - `recType` `'activity'` → `'hybrid'` for non-transport — ⚠️ **REGRESSION found in #132 grill audit:** backend `hybrid` runs only route-based finders (all bail `[]` when source has no `trip.route` = every non-transport contract) → spa/tour carts get ZERO recs, widget hides. Fix queued: backend `hybrid` fallthrough to `find_nearby_activities` when no route. See [[recommendation-engine-completion-roadmap]] P0 section.
  - GTM `checkout_recommendation_empty` event added — observability when section returns 0 results
  - Context-aware title: transport cart → "People also book", activity cart → "Complete your trip"

- **Spec analysis:** compared 10/10 spec against implementation. ~47% complete. Full gap report written. Key gaps: 3 zones not built (needs `find_complementary_contracts()` + `find_upgrade_contracts()` backend), fallback layers 1–4 all missing, ranking formula only ~1/6 factors, GTM 3/6 events, weekly `booked_count` not available.

- **⚠️ NOT COMMITTED:** Both branches have uncommitted changes only. No PR, no push.

**Resume point (EXACT):**
1. **Commit + PR — FE branch `fix/people-also-book-title-image-price`:** 3 files changed (`ServiceCategoryBadge.js`, `CheckoutRelatedTrips.js`, `RecommendationCard.js`). `git add` those 3 + commit + push + open PR → develop.
2. **Commit + PR — BE branch `fix/recommendation-serializer-fields`:** 2 files (`products/serializers.py`, `products/services.py`). Same flow → develop.
3. **After merge:** backend needs deploy for image/price/logo_url fixes to reach prod.
4. **Next eng work (v2):** `find_complementary_contracts()` backend (spa → transport cross-sell = highest AOV gain). Then 3-zone UI. See gap report in plan file.
5. **#129 ISR PROD ACTIVATION still pending** (BE develop → main + `FRONTEND_URL=www` + restart worker).

_(Session #130 block archived → `07-logs/session-history.md`.)_

**Carry-forward bugs (open, from #127):**
- **BE-IMAGE-DEDUP** tech debt (Section 2) — `process_operator_image` vs `process_review_image` dup + upload-validation copy-pasted ×5 files.
- silaphat `Operator.description` holds route notes, not real about-copy — data quality.
- `booking_count_yesterday` (`products/serializers.py:353-363`) — rolling 24h not calendar yesterday.
- Dual sort vocab: QuickSortPills PascalCase vs SortDropDown `-booked_count`.
- Prod backend git history diverged from origin (merge-noise) — pulls always merge, not FF. Cosmetic.

**Next session: starting state**
- vault: `master` @ new commit (this adds #131)
- BE: `fix/recommendation-serializer-fields` — uncommitted changes to `products/serializers.py` + `products/services.py`. Also on `develop` @ `4eaaf8d` for ISR work. **ISR develop NOT deployed to main/prod yet.**
- FE: `fix/people-also-book-title-image-price` — uncommitted changes to `ServiceCategoryBadge.js`, `CheckoutRelatedTrips.js`, `RecommendationCard.js`.
- FE `main` = `develop` @ `35c524d` — duration fix + ISR route, **SHIPPED TO PROD.**
- admin-dashboard: `main` @ `874d74d` (unchanged)
- content: `master` @ `3756e5b` (clean)
- ⚠️ Both recommendation branches need commit + PR → develop before merging.
- ⚠️ #129 ISR activation: BE-only remaining — deploy BE develop→main + set prod `FRONTEND_URL=www` + restart worker.

## Section 2 — Loose Ends (Open)

| # | Issue | Status | Where |
|---|-------|--------|-------|
| **REC-HYBRID-REGRESSION** | P0. Non-transport carts (spa/tour/ticket) got ZERO recommendations → widget hid. Backend `hybrid` ran only route-based finders (all `[]` with no `trip.route`). **FIXED #132** (`841e59f` on `fix/recommendation-serializer-fields`): `get_recommendations` — `hybrid` + no `trip.route` → `find_nearby_activities`. Test `test_hybrid_nontransport_returns_activities` added (13/14 pass; 1 unrelated pre-existing fail `test_find_similar_contracts`). `manage.py check` clean, caller-safe (serializer type-agnostic). **Data verified: ALL 33 active non-transport contracts have `primary_location` → all now produce recs (not data-gated).** Bundled w/ image/price/logo_url on same branch. | FIXED #132, NEEDS PR→develop + BE deploy. | `smartenplus-backend/products/services.py:691`, [[recommendation-engine-completion-roadmap]] |
| **REC-PRECOMPUTE-CACHEKEY** | Low. `products/tasks.py:67` precompute builds cache key `recommendations:{id}:{type}:{limit}` (4-part) but `get_recommendations:667` runtime key is 5-part (`:{rate_date or 'none'}`). Precompute writes never hit at runtime → wasted warm. Pre-existing, found in #132 verify. | OPEN #132 — out of scope of P0 fix. | `smartenplus-backend/products/tasks.py:67` |
| **ISR-REVALIDATE-GAP** | Admin contract edit not reaching prod `/activities/detail` (revalidate 3600) + `/trips/detail` (revalidate 300). Backend busts Redis correctly (`operators/signals.py:33`); Next.js Pages-Router ISR HTML never told to regen + no `/api/revalidate` route → stale, forever on cold pages (persistent `next_cache` volume). Fix (4 steps, build order in plan): (1) BE `daily_counter`→`.update(F+1)` enabler stops per-view post_save, (2) FE `pages/api/revalidate.js` POSTs `{slug}` owns path map, (3) BE `revalidate_frontend_isr` Celery task + `_trigger_revalidate` signal helper, (4) `REVALIDATION_SECRET` both repos incl GH Actions runtime path. Task no-ops on empty secret. | **IMPLEMENTED #129 → develop** (BE `4eaaf8d`, FE `66d896e`). All 4 steps done + verified (29 tests, manage.py check, ESLint, no-storm proof). **Prod root cause found:** `FRONTEND_URL` was apex → 301→www dropped the POST; fixed default→www (`d37dee3`). **FE SHIPPED #130** (main `35c524d` carries ISR route). **BE ACTIVATION PENDING:** deploy BE develop→main + set prod `FRONTEND_URL=www` + restart worker, then smoke-test (see Section 1 resume). | `operators/signals.py`, `operators/tasks.py`, `products/views.py:884`, `Smartenplus/settings.py:373`, FE `pages/api/revalidate.js`, `deploy-ghcr.sh` |
| **DURATION-DAYS-CARDS** | Day-tour browse cards omit duration: public LIST `ContractSerializer` doesn't expose `tour_duration_days`, so cards can't show "N Days" (detail page works, uses `__all__`). FE-only fix #130 chose omission over false "1 Day". Option B: add `tour_duration_days` to list serializer `fields`. One-line, low risk (read-only int); needs BE deploy + ISR cache clear. | OPEN #130 — optional follow-up, low priority. FE helper unchanged either way. | `smartenplus-backend/operators/serializers.py` (ContractSerializer), [[category-aware-duration-formatter]] |
| **BE-IMAGE-DEDUP** | BE image-processing duplication (moderate, pre-existing). Cluster 1: WebP resize/compress algorithm duplicated ~2-3× — `operators/utils.py:process_operator_image` (now parametrized #126b), `dialogue/utils.py:process_review_image` (120KB hardcoded), plus WebP/thumbnail code in `operators/admin.py`. Cluster 2: upload validation (ext whitelist + size) copy-pasted across 5 files (`stations/views.py`, `operators/utils.py`, `operators/views.py`, `pages_info/models.py`, `dialogue/utils.py`) each with own constants → drift risk. Consolidate → one `core/image_utils.py`: `process_image_to_webp(file, *, max_output_size, max_dimensions)` + `validate_upload(file, *, allowed_ext, max_size)`, migrate all callers. | OPEN #126 — dedicated refactor session. High blast radius (operators/dialogue/stations/pages_info), zero user value, all spots work. Do NOT bolt onto feature work. | `operators/utils.py`, `dialogue/utils.py` |
| **VAULT-DATE-RENAMES** | 105 files embed dates in filenames (violates "no dates in filenames" rule). Rename breaks every inbound wikilink. Needs separate planning round: `git mv` + atomic search-replace of all `[[old-name]]` → `[[new-name]]`. | OPEN #125 — next-wave vault work. | [[vault-optimization-snapshot-2026-06-16]] |
| **SEO-SITEMAP-FIX** | Implement fixes from whole-site SEO+sitemap audit | MERGED 2026-06-12. P0+P1+P2 `1f3f7a2` merged → develop `d88f50b`, pushed. Fake reviews ×4 deleted, sitemap 128→86 URLs, noindex fixed ×5 pages, dead JSON-LD pipeline removed. Build exit 0, greps clean. **Remaining:** deploy to prod, GSC Googlebot/WAF verify (manual), nginx 301s (infra), P3 dead-code sweep. Soft-404 stays with GSC-1. | develop `d88f50b`, [[seo-sitemap-whole-site-audit-2026-06-11]] |
| **CROSS-SELL-BD-INVENTORY** | BD creates Koh Lipe inventory to activate cross-sell | OPEN. BD task — no eng work. Needs: (1) return route Koh Lipe→Hat Yai Airport, (2) DAY_TOUR contracts at Koh Lipe, (3) SPA_WELLNESS contracts at Koh Lipe. Cross-sell auto-hides until `recommendation_count > 0`. **All 4 FE surfaces already live and verified 2026-06-13. GTM `item_category` + activity-detail accuracy ALSO already shipped (`hooks/useOmisePayment.js:59`+`:144`, `RelatedExperiences.js:7`) — were wrongly listed as open eng work.** Only BD inventory blocks value. Sole open eng item: multi-item post-booking (`bookingContext.js:33`, Sprint 2, not urgent). See [[cross-sell-integration-status-2026-06-13]]. | BD action |
| **IMG-ALT-DEBUG-1** | Next.js HMR cross-module callback staleness | OPEN. Optional refactor: move mutation call INTO dialog component, drop parent `onSubmit` indirection. Atom: [[nextjs-hmr-cross-module-callback-staleness]]. Low priority. | `pages/routemanagement/operators/images/ImageEditDialog.js`, `index.js:140-178` |
| F11-FOLLOWUP | B2B corporate CTA strip | DEFERRED. BD recommended. Awaits product decision on 280px slot. | TBD |
| F11-FOLLOWUP | Shared `<Accordion>` / `<FAQAccordion>` atom | DEFERRED. UX flagged. | `components/UI/` (new file) |
| RR-1-FOLLOWUP | `submit-review/[...slug].js:77` brittle slug fallback | API returns `booking_item_slug` only. Confirm contract. Low priority. | `pages/rate-review/submit-review/[...slug].js:77` |
| GSC-1 | GSC Crawled-Not-Indexed | Phase 1+2 shipped, monitoring. Phase 3 needs backend `route_exists`. | `seoConfig.js:41`, `server-sitemap.xml` |
| CMA-1 | Contract Model Ambiguity | P1/P2 partial. Remaining: data inventory. | `operators/models.py` |
| FAQ-1 | ExperienceFAQ | P0-P2 done. Admin `ageRestriction` deferred. | `admin-dashboard/DayTripDetails.js` |
| AT-1 | Airport Transfer redesign | P0. Spec: `03-knowledge/transportation-category-audit`. | `AirportTransferRouteCard.js` |
| AT-2 | Airport-transfer width mismatch | Inner margins. | `StationInformation.js` etc. |
| 15 | refetchOnMountOrArgChange | Needs justification. | `useTripData.js:16,24` |
| 1 | AdminBookingSummaryViewSet auth | Needs frontend sign-off. | `orders/views.py` |
| 2 | Delete RefundViewSet | Waiting on zero DEPRECATED_ENDPOINT_USED. | `cards/views.py` |
| 3 | Remove Stripe 410 stub | Waiting on zero prod traffic. | `payments/urls.py` |
| 8 | Forex endpoint naming | Naming debt. | `cards/urls.py` |
| Nav | NavigationSection empty | Restart backend + populate. | `pages_info` |
| Explore | location_type CharField | Needs `Location` model change. | `stations/models.py` |
| HD-2 | CartButton dim (70%) | Low — acceptable. | `CartButton.js:116` |
| HD-3 | xl padding gap | Low. | `main-header.js:90` |
| HD-6 | Logo size jump | P2. | `main-header.js:66,95` |
| GAP-3 | Mobile position flip | P2. | `main-header.js:45-77` |
| GAP-5 | Nav hidden while searching | P2 — accepted. | `main-header.js:112` |
| GAP-6 | threshold=0 abrupt snap | P3. | `useStickyVisibility.js:12` |
| GAP-7 | Wordmark hidden md-xl | P3. | `main-header.js:95` |
