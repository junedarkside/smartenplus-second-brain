## Section 1 — Session Handoff

**Updated:** 2026-06-17 (session #128 END)

**Session #128 (diagnosis + plan only, NO code):** ISR-REVALIDATE-GAP root-caused (admin contract edit not reaching prod activities+trips detail pages). Backend Redis bust works; Next.js Pages-Router ISR HTML never regenerated + no `/api/revalidate` route = the gap. 4-step fix plan APPROVED at `~/.claude/plans/create-team-to-check-jaunty-goblet.md` (not implemented). Vault ISR notes extended/corrected. See Section 2 **ISR-REVALIDATE-GAP**. _(#127 block below retained — its prod-restart verify still open.)_

---


**Achieved this session (#127) — Operator cover_image pipeline upgrade + orphan cleanup, SHIPPED + DEPLOYED:**
- **COVER-PIPELINE** (BE `7040f8d`): cover upload now runs through `process_operator_image` (was raw store). Parametrized the function — `process_operator_image(image_file, max_output_size=100*1024, max_dimensions=(1200,800,600))`, defaults reproduce old gallery behavior (gallery caller at `views.py` untouched). Cover calls it with `max_output_size=300*1024, max_dimensions=(1920,1600,1200)` → WebP, crisp hero budget, HEIC/HEIF/AVIF accepted server-side (pillow-heif).
- **ADMIN HEIC** (admin `874d74d`): extracted `isHeic`/`convertHeicToJpeg` from `DropFilesInput.js` to shared `components/utils/imageHelpers.js` (DropFilesInput now imports them — gallery unchanged). `OperatorForm.handleCoverFileChange` async: decodes iPhone HEIC→JPEG for preview, widened whitelist + `accept` to HEIC/HEIF. Server re-encodes to WebP regardless.
- **ORPHAN CLEANUP** (BE `dbbbe97`): `OperatorViewSet.update` now deletes the replaced logo/cover file from S3 (Django doesn't auto-delete; no django-cleanup). New `_safe_delete_storage_file` helper (mirrors `signals.py` post_delete pattern), runs AFTER save, guarded on name change, non-fatal (logged, never 500s). Gallery path untouched (cover/logo are bare ImageFields, NOT Asset-tracked, unique uuid names → zero gallery side-effect).
- **Impact analysis done** (user-requested): confirmed gallery upload, smartenplus-frontend review component, and `dialogue.process_review_image` all UNAFFECTED — separate stacks/functions. Only cover behavior changed.
- **DEPLOYED to prod**: backend merged develop→main (`dbbbe97`), prod server `git pull` landed it (merge `dcbcd76` on prod). All 3 repos on `main`.

_(Session #126 cover-hero block archived → `07-logs/session-history.md`.)_

**Resume point (EXACT):**
1. **Confirm prod apps restarted after pull** — `git pull` updates files but running gunicorn/Next keeps old code until restart. Verify cover WebP + HEIC actually live (upload test, check returned `cover_image` ends `.webp`).
2. **AT-1 — Airport Transfer redesign (P0).** Spec: `03-knowledge/airport-transfer-at1-redesign-spec.md`. `AirportTransferRouteCard.js` + BE `products/serializers.py` (additive serializer expansion only).
3. **TripDetailSchedule fareCalendar fix** (deferred): `useGetFareCalendarQuery` + `skipToken`. See [[slidecalendar2-farecalendar-prop-pattern]].

**Carry-forward bugs (open):**
- **BE-IMAGE-DEDUP** tech debt tracked in Section 2 — `process_operator_image` vs `process_review_image` dup + upload-validation copy-pasted ×5 files.
- silaphat `Operator.description` holds route notes, not real about-copy — data quality. Edit via admin form when desired.
- `booking_count_yesterday` (BE `products/serializers.py:353-363`) — rolling 24h not calendar yesterday.
- Hero trust signals UNGATED — accepted.
- Dual sort vocab: QuickSortPills PascalCase vs SortDropDown `-booked_count`.
- Dashboard "Total Bookings" InfoCard (admin `Main.js:155`) mislabeled. Untracked, low priority.
- `precompute_contract_on_create()` Celery signal warning in test logs. Pre-existing. Untracked.
- Prod backend git history diverged from origin (259 merge-noise commits ahead, content = same) — pulls always merge, not FF. Set `core.mergeoptions --no-edit` on prod to skip vim. Cosmetic.

**Next session: starting state**
- vault: `master` @ new commit (this adds #127)
- BE: `main == develop` @ `dbbbe97` — **DEPLOYED** (prod merge `dcbcd76`). Cover WebP pipeline + HEIC + orphan cleanup (#127). ⚠️ confirm prod app restarted.
- FE: `main` @ `1609c38` — DEPLOYED (#126, unchanged this session).
- admin-dashboard: `main` @ `874d74d` — DEPLOYED. HEIC cover upload (#127).
- content: `master` @ `3756e5b` (clean)

## Section 2 — Loose Ends (Open)

| # | Issue | Status | Where |
|---|-------|--------|-------|
| **ISR-REVALIDATE-GAP** | Admin contract edit not reaching prod `/activities/detail` (revalidate 3600) + `/trips/detail` (revalidate 300). Backend busts Redis correctly (`operators/signals.py:33`); Next.js Pages-Router ISR HTML never told to regen + no `/api/revalidate` route → stale, forever on cold pages (persistent `next_cache` volume). Fix (4 steps, build order in plan): (1) BE `daily_counter`→`.update(F+1)` enabler stops per-view post_save, (2) FE `pages/api/revalidate.js` POSTs `{slug}` owns path map, (3) BE `revalidate_frontend_isr` Celery task + `_trigger_revalidate` signal helper, (4) `REVALIDATION_SECRET` both repos incl GH Actions runtime path. Task no-ops on empty secret. | **OPEN #128** — plan APPROVED, not yet implemented. debug-mantra+scrutinize verified, backend innocent. | plan: `~/.claude/plans/create-team-to-check-jaunty-goblet.md` · `operators/signals.py`, `products/views.py:882`, FE `pages/api/` |
| **BE-IMAGE-DEDUP** | BE image-processing duplication (moderate, pre-existing). Cluster 1: WebP resize/compress algorithm duplicated ~2-3× — `operators/utils.py:process_operator_image` (now parametrized #126b), `dialogue/utils.py:process_review_image` (120KB hardcoded), plus WebP/thumbnail code in `operators/admin.py`. Cluster 2: upload validation (ext whitelist + size) copy-pasted across 5 files (`stations/views.py`, `operators/utils.py`, `operators/views.py`, `pages_info/models.py`, `dialogue/utils.py`) each with own constants → drift risk. Consolidate → one `core/image_utils.py`: `process_image_to_webp(file, *, max_output_size, max_dimensions)` + `validate_upload(file, *, allowed_ext, max_size)`, migrate all callers. | OPEN #126 — dedicated refactor session. High blast radius (operators/dialogue/stations/pages_info), zero user value, all spots work. Do NOT bolt onto feature work. | `operators/utils.py`, `dialogue/utils.py` |
| **VAULT-DATE-RENAMES** | 105 files embed dates in filenames (violates "no dates in filenames" rule). Rename breaks every inbound wikilink. Needs separate planning round: `git mv` + atomic search-replace of all `[[old-name]]` → `[[new-name]]`. | OPEN #125 — next-wave vault work. | [[vault-optimization-snapshot-2026-06-16]] |
| **OPERATOR-DESC** | Operator `description` field (backend) → unblocks GEO "about operator" prose on `/operators/[slug]` (flagged in SEO/AEO/GEO audit, the one truly backend-blocked item). | **CLOSED #125** — verify-only: backend was already complete (`Operator.description = TextField()`, `OperatorDetailSerializer fields='__all__'`). Live curl confirmed populated text returned. FE wired About-{operator} section at `pages/operators/[slug].js:151` (FE `f75b411`). | done |
| **OPERATOR-TAB-COUNTS** | `by_type` aggregation (TRANSPORT-type only, computed pre-type-filter) on `OperatorContractsViewSet.list` summary → enables per-type counts in the operators page MUI tabs ("Join Tour (12)"). Frontend tabs already shipped without counts. | **CLOSED #125** — BE `0d6a3cf`, FE `f75b411`. `summary.by_type = {ALL, PRIVATE, JOIN, CHARTER}` keyed to `FILTER_TYPES`. Bug caught: `select_related` INNER JOIN was under-counting (15→3); fix = aggregate from `Contract.objects` directly. 4 invariance tests added (`operators/tests/test_operator_contracts_viewset.py`). | done |
| **MIN-RATE-BE-MERGE** | BE `fix/popular-routes-lowest-price` @ `4da0b81` — merge to develop + verify `/front-page/` Hatyai→Koh Lipe `lowest_price` matches SlideCalendar rate | **CLOSED 2026-06-16** — merged at `37387c8`, BE develop now `21fbdcf` | `smartenplus-backend/products/views.py:1197` |
| **TRIP-SEARCH-REDESIGN** | Travel Decision Engine + below-fold redesign of `/trips/[from]/[to]` | **CLOSED 2026-06-15.** R1+R2 fully shipped. FE `develop` @ `6f2ada9`. Deploy to prod pending (ops task). → `07-logs/closed-items.md` | [[trip-search-results-implementation-plan-2026-06-14]], [[trip-search-below-fold-redesign-2026-06-15]] |
| **TRUST-BADGE-BUG** | `getTrustBadges` Free-Cancellation inverted | **CLOSED 2026-06-14.** Fixed in Phase 0.5 — `refund_percentage === 0` → `=== 100`. Shipped in `feat/trip-search-redesign`, now on `develop`. | `helpers/getTrustBadges.js:19` |
| **PAYMENT-FIX** | Implement 5 HIGHs + priority MEDIUMs from payment deep review | **CLOSED 2026-06-13.** All 5 batches shipped + 8/8 E2E automated + webhook gap closed. **Both PRs MERGED:** FE merge `dae26da` (`main`), BE merge `5653b04` (`main`) — feature branches deleted. 119 tests pass. M4 retracted. | [[payment-deep-review-2026-06-12]], [[payment-auto-test-results-2026-06-12]], [[omise-webhook-tailscale-local-testing]] |
| **PAYMENT-DEADLOCK** | Recover paid-but-unfinalized order PLB0229785 from payment_pending deadlock | **CLOSED 2026-06-13.** Fix `482cfc6` "recover paid-but-unfinalized order from payment_pending deadlock" is head of BE `main`. 278 BE tests pass. | [[payment-pending-deadlock-2026-06-12]] |
| **DESIGN-SYSTEM-PHASE-1** | Token completion (audit 2026-06-13) | **CLOSED 2026-06-13.** OPACITY, Z_INDEX, TRANSITIONS, LAYOUT, SIDEBAR_CONFIG added (`helpers/designSystem.js:149-210`); token migration FE `489de5f`+`b5ce878` (18 files). Residual gaps (typography line-height/letter-spacing, 4 stray `#fff` in globals.css) trivial — untracked. | [[design-system-audit-2026-06-13]] |
| **KB-ATOMIZATION-PAYMENT** | 12 KB gaps from payment deep-review verification report | **DEFERRED.** Batch with next `/lint-vault`. M8 in `payment-backend-charge-flow.md` §5 verified accurate (email-guard ownership check present). | [[payment-deep-review-2026-06-12]] |

| **BOOKING-PAY-REPRO-1** | Runtime repro C1 (formData lost on hard refresh) + C2 (transient error nukes cartId) | CLOSED #97. C1: `isCartLoaded &&` guard in clear-assignments effect (`checkout/index.js:188`). C2: `if (error?.status === 404)` in catch (`check-and-createcart.js:67`). Commit `cb817d9` on `develop`. | `pages/checkout/index.js:188`, `components/HOC/check-and-createcart.js:67` |
| **CROSS-SELL-MERGE** | Merge `feat/redesign-people-also-book-cards` → `develop` | CLOSED #97. Branch confirmed fully merged (`git merge-base --is-ancestor` → FULLY MERGED). `CheckoutRelatedTrips` mounted at `checkout/index.js:1010`. All recommendation components present. Remaining work is BD inventory only → see CROSS-SELL-BD-INVENTORY. | done |
| **SEO-SITEMAP-FIX** | Implement fixes from whole-site SEO+sitemap audit | MERGED 2026-06-12. P0+P1+P2 `1f3f7a2` merged → develop `d88f50b`, pushed. Fake reviews ×4 deleted, sitemap 128→86 URLs, noindex fixed ×5 pages, dead JSON-LD pipeline removed. Build exit 0, greps clean. **Remaining:** deploy to prod, GSC Googlebot/WAF verify (manual), nginx 301s (infra), P3 dead-code sweep. Soft-404 stays with GSC-1. | develop `d88f50b`, [[seo-sitemap-whole-site-audit-2026-06-11]] |
| **CROSS-SELL-BD-INVENTORY** | BD creates Koh Lipe inventory to activate cross-sell | OPEN. BD task — no eng work. Needs: (1) return route Koh Lipe→Hat Yai Airport, (2) DAY_TOUR contracts at Koh Lipe, (3) SPA_WELLNESS contracts at Koh Lipe. Cross-sell auto-hides until `recommendation_count > 0`. **All 4 FE surfaces already live and verified 2026-06-13. GTM `item_category` + activity-detail accuracy ALSO already shipped (`hooks/useOmisePayment.js:59`+`:144`, `RelatedExperiences.js:7`) — were wrongly listed as open eng work.** Only BD inventory blocks value. Sole open eng item: multi-item post-booking (`bookingContext.js:33`, Sprint 2, not urgent). See [[cross-sell-integration-status-2026-06-13]]. | BD action |
| **BRANCH-CLEANUP-REMOTE** | 81 merged remote `origin/2606*` branches pending deletion | CLOSED #97. 42 actual branches deleted (vault count was stale). `git branch -r \| grep origin/2606 \| wc -l` → 0. `git fetch --prune` run. 45 remote branches remain (all active). | done |
| **FRONTEND-AUDIT-FIX-1** | Audit finding 3 (Formik render-prop useEffect) | CLOSED #95. PR1 `fix/audit-checkout-passengers-hooks` (e5261ab → 1e46314). New `FormikValuesSync.js` (105 lines) absorbs both effects via useFormikContext. Rules-of-hooks invariant restored. Lint clean. | `components/forms/checkout/FormikValuesSync.js`, `Passengers.js` |
| **FRONTEND-AUDIT-FIX-2** | Audit findings 1+2+4+5 (RTK Query) | CLOSED #95. PR2 `fix/audit-rtk-query-cleanup` (ecc76a9 → b6b956e). getSession pattern, activities key, cart-version extract, createCart single invalidation. New `store/cart-version.js` (12 lines). 3 sources of truth → 1. Lint clean. | `store/cart-version.js`, `store/cart-slice.js`, `store/api/*`, `store/index.js` |
| **FRONTEND-AUDIT-FIX-3** | Audit findings 6+7+8+9 (dead code + hygiene) | CLOSED #95. PR3 `chore/audit-deadcode-and-hygiene` (d69b473 → fbe9aab). 31 files, 4237 deletions, 7 insertions.

| **FRONTEND-AUDIT-FOLLOWUP-1** | 2 exhaustive-deps warnings in FormikValuesSync.js:61:6 | CLOSED #97. Suppression comments added. Effect 1: refs + useState setter stable by definition. Effect 2: `cartitems?.cart_item` kept (not `cartitems`) — tighter RTK refetch trigger. Lint clean. Commit `7107516`. | `FormikValuesSync.js` |
| **FRONTEND-AUDIT-MANUAL-PRS** | Open 3 PRs on GitHub manually | DROPPED #97. All 3 branches confirmed merged into develop (`git branch -r --merged develop`). Merge commits `e5261ab`, `b6b956e`, `fbe9aab` in git log are the audit record. Retroactive PRs add no value. | 3 remote branches |
